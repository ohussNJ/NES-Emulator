# NES-Emulator
### Compiling
You need:
* SFML 2.0+ development headers and library
* C++11 compliant compiler
* CMake build system

Compiling is straight forward with cmake, just run cmake on the project directory with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
and you'll get Makefile or equivalent for your platform, with which you can compile the emulator
